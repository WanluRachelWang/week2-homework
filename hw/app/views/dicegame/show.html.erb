<h1>Dice Game</h1>
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Here are the rules:</p>
<ul>Roll the dice to start the game.</ul>
<ul>If your first roll is a 7 or 11, you win.</ul>
<ul>If your first roll is a 2,3, or 12, you lose.</ul>
<ul>Anything else becomes your goal. Roll your goal again before rolling a 7, and you win. Roll a 7 instead of your goal, and you lose.</ul>
